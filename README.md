# led
This project supports LED strips that are controlled using MQTT. All of this was coded up using raspberry pi zeros (control the LED strips and the MQTT Server)
There is another project that based on similar code but handles an LED sign made from cutting up an LED strip and resoldering it together.
Note: This is a work in progress. Some code still needs clean up.
